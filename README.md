### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** News / Sports
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily used for mobile so sports enthusiasts can view current sports events and games happening. This app could definitely be transfered onto a website and be viewed, such as ESPN. 
- **Story:** Sports enthusiasts are able to watch their favorite sports and see the highlights of the games without actually viewing the whole game. They're able to conviniently purchase tickets to games without the need to download others apps. 
- **Market:** Any individual interested in sports would be able to download this app, but they would need to input their age to filter anything inappropriate. 
- **Habit:** This app is primarily going to depend on how important sports are to the user, and how much they view highlights. 
- **Scope:** The app will first start out with a couple of sports, but it could expand into other sports later down the line. Tickets to other sports events can also be bought for the sports we add to the app.
